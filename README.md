Public goods networks project - spillovers in pump maintenance

I am a 3rd year Economics PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania.

This project is a work in progress, and may use multiple data sources and different types of model. The primary data sources are all 'water point mapping' databases, which give the location, functionality status and other characteristics of pumps in developing countries.
